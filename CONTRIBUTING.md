# Contributing to Mafiasource

Thanks for your interest. Our goal is to maintain an open-source text-based mafia rpg inspired by crimeclub. Our contributing guidelines have been written with the help of the following [Java example](https://alvinalexander.com/java/jwarehouse/deeplearning4j/CONTRIBUTING.md.shtml)

## Getting Started

Mafiasource's [open issues are here](https://github.com/Mafiasource/Mafiasource/issues). In time, we'll tag issues that would make a good first pull request for new contributors. An easy way to get started helping the project is to *file an issue*. You can do that on the Mafiasource issues page by clicking on the green button at the right. Issues can include bugs to fix, features to add, or requesting documentation. 

For some tips on contributing to our hobbyist open source project, this [post might be helpful](https://github.com/Mafiasource/Mafiasource/wiki/Writing-future-compatible-code).

## Contributions

Mafiasource welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions to Mafiasource should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will
be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the
main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should run flawless in production). 

- Don't put submodule updates in your pull request unless they are to landed
  commits.

- If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review
  it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a
  comment.

## Tests

Project doesn't contain any tests and we don't expect tests to be written. We do however demand flawless
runtime and browser execution. Make sure possible logged errors are resolved before pushing anything.
Also make sure that existing code updates are tested thoroughly at their (un)related option(s).

## Documentation

Our project contains little documentation out of the box. If you're having trouble understanding a piece
of code please create a github issue requesting for more information on specific line numbers in files.
As this is a custom hobbyist project you can expect answers to come in human readable format. We hope to
bring documentation in the future.
